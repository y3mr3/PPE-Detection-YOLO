# PPE-Detection-YOLO

The following are the steps you can follow to train your dataset in google colaboratory. 
The following are the steps you should follow to train your custom Yolo model:

1. Create dataset compatible with the YOLO format. [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
2. Divide the dataset into train-test format.(train_test.py)
3. Modify the cfg file.
4. Prepare the data into a zip according to the google colaboratory.
5. Load the prepared data into the drive account of google.
6. [Train the model at Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yy3f6s8fC1Ky5YUoUjEpfdPTRTE67KGC?usp=sharing)
7. Save model in specific steps(1000-2000..).[Here are the weight results of my dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kP2WNz3o3WvuT1XhlVWK4eQ5biXiBm_Q?usp=sharing)
8. Download model to test at local.
9. Finally, test the model for image, video and webcam.[My video and webcam results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcAcoKf-4y0&list=PL8OxPIrXWurYzjNjTFmAH6GowpAs0YzlU&ab_channel=YUNUSEMREBARDIZ)
